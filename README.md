# ansible
An Ansible demo

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that is best used for tasks like DSC (desired state configuration) and IaC (infrastructure as code)

Directory Structure: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/sample_setup.html#alternative-directory-layout

## To-Do
- OIDC?
- 

### For Me
create a ansible.cfg file with
```
[defaults]
interpreter_python = /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
```
if you are getting linting issues
